## ✨ Features

🔹 **Live User Data Fetching**  
Fetches user data in real time from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users), a free REST API for testing and prototyping.

🔹 **Responsive Design**  
Carefully crafted with CSS to ensure that it looks great on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop screens.

🔹 **Dynamic UI Rendering**  
Each user’s name, email, and address is dynamically inserted into the DOM with JavaScript.

🔹 **Graceful Error Handling**  
If there's a network issue (like turning off the internet), the app catches the error and displays a friendly, styled message.

🔹 **Reload Button**  
Want to re-fetch the data or simulate a retry? Just click the **Reload** button!
